Embeddings are handled by the `SentenceTransformer` class, which is a wrapper around the `sentence-transformers` library.

## Installation

Embeddings require the `sentence-transformers` library. See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation) for more information.   

## Usage

```python
from chonkie import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings

embeddings = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```
