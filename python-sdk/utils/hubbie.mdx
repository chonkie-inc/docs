Hubbie is a utility for accessing Chonkie's saved recipes. Recipes are pre-defined chunking rules for different languages and document types. When initializing a chunker with `from_recipe`, you can pass in the recipe name and language to use the recipe.

## Installation

To make use of Hubbie, you'll need to install the `hub` optional install.

```bash
pip install "chonkie[hub]"
```

## Usage

```python
from chonkie import RecursiveChunker

# Initialize the recursive chunker with the recipe name and language
chunker = RecursiveChunker.from_recipe("markdown", lang="en")

# Chunk the text
text = ... # Your text string

# CHONK!
chunks = chunker(text)
```

## Recipes
