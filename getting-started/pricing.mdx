Chonkie offers flexible options to suit your needs, whether you prefer self-hosting or using our managed cloud service.

## Chonkie Library (Open Source)

ü¶õ **It's Free!** ‚ú®

The core Chonkie library is **completely open-source** under the MIT license. You can:

-   **Install and use it freely** in your projects.
-   **Self-host** the chunking capabilities within your own infrastructure without any cost from us.
-   Access all the chunkers like `TokenChunker`, `SentenceChunker`, `RecursiveChunker`, `SemanticChunker`, `SDPMChunker`, `LateChunker`, and `CodeChunker` locally.

Get started by following the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation).

## Chonkie Cloud (Hosted API)

‚òÅÔ∏è **Managed Service** ‚òÅÔ∏è

For those who prefer a hassle-free, managed solution, we offer **Chonkie Cloud**. This is a hosted API service that lets you leverage Chonkie's chunking power without managing the infrastructure.

-   **Usage-based Pricing:** Chonkie Cloud operates on a pay-as-you-go model.
-   **API Key Required:** Access requires an API key, which you can obtain from the [Chonkie Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.chonkie.ai/keys) after signing up.
-   **Simple Integration:** Easily integrate chunking into your applications via HTTP requests using our [Python client](/chonkie-cloud/overview#basic-usage) or standard tools like `cURL`.
