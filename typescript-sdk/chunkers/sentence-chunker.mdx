The `SentenceChunker` splits text into chunks based on sentences, ensuring each chunk maintains complete sentences and stays within specified token limits. This is ideal for preparing text for models that work best with semantically complete units, or for consistent chunking across different texts.

## API Reference

To use the `SentenceChunker` via the API, check out the [API reference documentation](../../api-reference/sentence-chunker).

## Initialization

```ts
import { SentenceChunker } from "chonkie";

// Basic initialization with default parameters (async)
const chunker = await SentenceChunker.create({
  tokenizer: "Xenova/gpt2", // Supports string identifiers or Tokenizer instance
  chunkSize: 512,            // Maximum tokens per chunk
  chunkOverlap: 128,         // Overlap between chunks
  minSentencesPerChunk: 1    // Minimum sentences per chunk
});

// Using a custom tokenizer
import { Tokenizer } from "@huggingface/transformers";
const customTokenizer = await Tokenizer.from_pretrained("your-tokenizer");
const chunker = await SentenceChunker.create({
  tokenizer: customTokenizer,
  chunkSize: 512,
  chunkOverlap: 128
});
```

## Parameters

<ParamField
    path="tokenizer"
    type="string | Tokenizer"
    default="Xenova/gpt2"
>
    Tokenizer to use. Can be a string identifier (model name) or a Tokenizer instance. Defaults to using `Xenova/gpt2` tokenizer.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="chunkSize"
    type="number"
    default="512"
>
    Maximum number of tokens per chunk.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="chunkOverlap"
    type="number"
    default="0"
>
    Number of overlapping tokens between chunks. Must be >= 0 and < chunkSize.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="minSentencesPerChunk"
    type="number"
    default="1"
>
    Minimum number of sentences per chunk. Must be > 0.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="minCharactersPerSentence"
    type="number"
    default="12"
>
    Minimum number of characters for a valid sentence. Sentences shorter than this are merged with adjacent sentences.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="approximate"
    type="boolean"
    default="false"
>
    (Deprecated) Whether to use approximate token counting.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="delim"
    type="string[]"
    default="[. , ! , ? , \n]"
>
    List of sentence delimiters to use for splitting. Default: `[". ", "! ", "? ", "\n"]`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="includeDelim"
    type="'prev' | 'next' | null"
    default="prev"
>
    Whether to include the delimiter with the previous sentence (`"prev"`), next sentence (`"next"`), or exclude it (`null`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="returnType"
    type="'chunks' | 'texts'"
    default="chunks"
>
    Whether to return chunks as `SentenceChunk` objects (with metadata) or plain text strings.
</ParamField>

## Usage

### Single Text Chunking

```ts
const text = "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence! And here's a third one?";
const chunks = await chunker.chunk(text);

for (const chunk of chunks) {
  console.log(`Chunk text: ${chunk.text}`);
  console.log(`Token count: ${chunk.tokenCount}`);
  console.log(`Number of sentences: ${chunk.sentences.length}`);
}
```

### Batch Chunking

```ts
const texts = [
  "First document. With multiple sentences.",
  "Second document. Also with sentences. And more context."
];
const batchChunks = await chunker.chunkBatch(texts);

for (const docChunks of batchChunks) {
  for (const chunk of docChunks) {
    console.log(`Chunk: ${chunk.text}`);
  }
}
```

### Using as a Callable

```ts
// Single text
const chunks = await chunker("First sentence. Second sentence.");

// Multiple texts
const batchChunks = await chunker(["Text 1. More text.", "Text 2. More."]);
```

## Return Type

SentenceChunker returns chunks as `SentenceChunk` objects by default. Each chunk includes metadata:

```ts
class SentenceChunk {
  text: string;        // The chunk text
  startIndex: number;  // Starting position in original text
  endIndex: number;    // Ending position in original text
  tokenCount: number;  // Number of tokens in chunk
  sentences: Sentence[]; // List of sentences in the chunk
}

class Sentence {
  text: string;        // The sentence text
  startIndex: number;  // Starting position in original text
  endIndex: number;    // Ending position in original text
  tokenCount: number;  // Number of tokens in sentence
}
```

If `returnType` is set to `'texts'`, only the chunked text strings are returned.

---

**Notes:**

- The chunker is directly callable as a function after creation: `const chunks = await chunker(text)` or `await chunker([text1, text2])`.
- If `returnType` is set to `'chunks'`, each chunk includes metadata: `text`, `startIndex`, `endIndex`, `tokenCount`, and the list of `sentences`.
- The chunker ensures that no chunk exceeds the specified `chunkSize` in tokens, and that each chunk contains at least `minSentencesPerChunk` sentences (except possibly the last chunk).
- Sentences shorter than `minCharactersPerSentence` are merged with adjacent sentences.
- Overlap is specified in tokens, and the chunker will overlap sentences as needed to meet the overlap requirement.
- You can customize sentence splitting using the `delim` and `includeDelim` options.
