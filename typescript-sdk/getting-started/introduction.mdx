Ever found yourself making a RAG pipeline yet again (your 2,342,148th one), only to realize you're stuck having to write chunking with bloated software library X or the painfully feature-less library Y?
_WHY CAN'T THIS JUST BE SIMPLE, UGH?_

Well, look no further than Chonkie TS! (chonkie boi is a gud boi ü¶õ)

## Quick Start

Get started with Chonkie TS in three simple steps: Install, Import and CHONK!

```bash
npm install chonkie
```

Want minimal dependencies? Install with optional dependencies omitted:
```bash
npm install chonkie --omit=optional
```

<Note>
  Chonkie TS follows a special approach to dependencies, keeping the base installation lightweight while allowing you to add extra features as and when needed.
  Please check the [Installation](/installation) page for more details.
</Note>

Release the CHONK! ü¶õ‚ú®

```typescript
import { TokenChunker } from 'chonkie';

async function main() {
  // Create a token chunker with default options
  const chunker = await TokenChunker.create();

  // Here's some text to chunk
  const text = "Woah! Chonkie is such a great ts library!";

  // Chunk some text
  const chunks = await chunker.chunk(text);

  // Access chunks
  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log(chunk.token_count);
  }
}

main();
```

<Note>
  Chonkie TS is a port of the original Python library, designed specifically for TypeScript developers. While it maintains the core functionality, it adds type safety and TypeScript-specific features. The library is under active development and working towards feature parity with the original Python version.
