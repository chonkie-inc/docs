<Update label="v1.0.5">
  # v1.0.5 Release Highlights âœ¨

  This is a quick patch release to include `CodeChunker` in the `__init__.py` for `chonkie` so it can be properly accessed via `from chonkie import CodeChunker`.
  
  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie/compare/v1.0.4...v1.0.5

<Update label="v1.0.4">
  # v1.0.4 Release Highlights âœ¨

  - **New `CodeChunker`**: Introducing the `CodeChunker`, specialized for handling code files across 100+ programming languages. It understands code structure to provide more meaningful chunks.
  
  ```bash
  pip install "chonkie[code]"
  ```

  ```python  
  # Initialize the code chunker
  chunker = CodeChunker(language="python")

  # Chunk the code
  code = ... # Your code string

  # CHONK!
  chunks = chunker(code)
  ```

  - **`JinaAI` Embeddings Support**: Added `JinaEmbeddings`, enabling their use with `SemanticChunker` and `SDPMChunker`. Just install the `jina` optional install to use it! 

  ```bash
  pip install "chonkie[jina]"
  ```

  ```python
  # Initialize the Jina embeddings  
  from chonkie import JinaEmbeddings, SemanticChunker
  
  # Initialize the Jina embeddings
  embeddings = JinaEmbeddings()

  # Initialize the semantic chunker
  chunker = SemanticChunker(embeddings)

  # Chunk the text
  text = ... # Your text string

  # CHONK!
  chunks = chunker(text)
  ```

  - **`OverlapRefinery`**: Enhance your chunks by adding overlapping context using the new `OverlapRefinery`. It's included in the default install and works seamlessly with any chunker.
  
  ```python
  # Initialize the recursive chunker  
  from chonkie import RecursiveChunker, OverlapRefinery
  chunker = RecursiveChunker()

  # Initialize the overlap refinery
  refinery = OverlapRefinery() # Or OverlapRefinery("gpt2")

  # Chunk the text
  text = ... # Your text string

  # CHONK!
  chunks = chunker(text)

  # Refine the chunks
  chunks = refinery(chunks)
  ```

  - **`EmbeddingsRefinery`**: Compute and attach embeddings directly to your chunks using the `EmbeddingsRefinery`. Streamline the process of loading chunks into vector databases.
  
  ```python
  from chonkie import RecursiveChunker, EmbeddingsRefinery, JinaEmbeddings

  # Initialize the recursive chunker
  chunker = RecursiveChunker()

  # Initialize the embeddings model
  # Here we use Jina embeddings for this example, but you can use any other embeddings model
  embeddings = JinaEmbeddings()

  # Initialize the embeddings refinery
  refinery = EmbeddingsRefinery(embeddings)

  # Chunk the text
  text = ... # Your text string
  chunks = chunker(text)
  chunks = refinery(chunks) # Each chunk now has a .embedding attribute
    ```

<Update label="v1.0.3">
  # v1.0.3 Release Highlights âœ¨

  * **Chonkie `Visualizer`**: Visualize and debug chunks easily via terminal printouts or HTML saves. Understand chunk quality and debug your chunker with visual feedback~ Use the `print` method to print rich text on your terminal or use the `save` method to save a highlighted `html` on your device! It's very simple to use, just pass in your chunks~

    ```python
    from chonkie import Visualizer

    viz = Visualizer()

    # Print the chunks on the terminal with .print or directly call the Visualizer object too
    viz.print(chunks) 

    # Save the HTML file
    viz.save("chonkie.html", chunks)
    ```

  * **Recipes**: Chonkie now adds support for `Recipes` which allow you to use multilingual chunking out-of-the-box, as well as document specific chunking methods. Initial support starts with: `en`, `hi`, `zh`, `jp` and `ko`, while document type `markdown` is supported too. Use it via the `from_recipe` class method with any chunker that takes delimiters or `RecursiveRules`.

    ```python
    from chonkie import RecursiveChunker

    # Initialize the recursive chunker to chunk Markdown
    chunker = RecursiveChunker.from_recipe("markdown", lang="en")

    # Initialize the recursive chunker to chunk Hindi texts
    chunker = RecursiveChunker.from_recipe(lang="hi")
    ```

  * Performance enhancements in `RecursiveChunker`, `SentenceChunker`, and `WordTokenizer`.
