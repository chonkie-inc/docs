<Update label="v1.0.3">
  # v1.0.3 Release Highlights âœ¨

  * **Chonkie `Visualizer`**: Visualize and debug chunks easily via terminal printouts or HTML saves. Understand chunk quality and debug your chunker with visual feedback~ Use the `print` method to print rich text on your terminal or use the `save` method to save a highlighted `html` on your device! It's very simple to use, just pass in your chunks~

    ```python
    from chonkie import Visualizer

    viz = Visualizer()

    # Print the chunks on the terminal with .print or directly call the Visualizer object too
    viz.print(chunks) 

    # Save the HTML file
    viz.save("chonkie.html", chunks)
    ```

  * **Recipes**: Chonkie now adds support for `Recipes` which allow you to use multilingual chunking out-of-the-box, as well as document specific chunking methods. Initial support starts with: `en`, `hi`, `zh`, `jp` and `ko`, while document type `markdown` is supported too. Use it via the `from_recipe` class method with any chunker that takes delimiters or `RecursiveRules`.

    ```python
    from chonkie import RecursiveChunker

    # Initialize the recursive chunker to chunk Markdown
    chunker = RecursiveChunker.from_recipe("markdown", lang="en")

    # Initialize the recursive chunker to chunk Hindi texts
    chunker = RecursiveChunker.from_recipe(lang="hi")
    ```

  * Performance enhancements in `RecursiveChunker`, `SentenceChunker`, and `WordTokenizer`.
